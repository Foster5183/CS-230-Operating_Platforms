Game Room Software Design Document 


The client, Game Room, aims to enhance an existing game, "Draw It or Lose It," to operate seamlessly across multiple platforms. The ultimate goal is to launch the game on a distributed network using cloud-
based infrastructure. "Draw It or Lose It" is a timed image guessing game that supports multiple teams and players, regardless of the device used to access the application. Additionally, the client 
requests the design and implementation of a database to manage player names, rankings, and high scores.

Strengths in Document Development:
One notable strength in this documentation is the comprehensive evaluation of different platforms, highlighting their advantages and limitations.

Benefits of the Design Document Process:
Working through the design document provided a clear visual representation of the code's expected functionality and operation. This process helps to ensure a shared understanding of project goals and 
requirements.

Area for Revision:
An area that could benefit from improvement is the hosting recommendations. More thorough research and analysis in this area would enhance the overall project.

Meeting User Needs:
The user's needs were well-understood and incorporated into the design. Aligning user needs with client requirements is crucial for project success, and in this case, both were in sync. User satisfaction 
is pivotal for project profitability.

Design Approach and Future Strategies:
The approach to designing the software was somewhat exploratory due to the lack of prior experience. In the future, it would be beneficial to begin with creating a Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram 
to establish a clearer understanding of the client's expectations for the code.
