Game Room Software Design Document 

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. 
The client Game Room would like to develop and transition an already existing game "Draw It or Lose It" to work across multiple platforms and ideally the game would be launched across a distrubited network using cloud based infastructure. The game itself is a timed image guessing game that can have multiple teams with multiple players iirespective of the device used to launch the application. The client also requires the design and implementaion of a database to track player names, ranking, and high scores.
